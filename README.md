# leaflet-challenge

This code sets up a web page with an interactive map that displays earthquake data using the Leaflet library. The map includes various layers with different styles, a legend showing the depth ranges of earthquakes, and markers representing the earthquakes themselves.

The code begins by adding an event listener to the window object. It waits for the "load" event to occur before executing the provided function. This ensures that the code inside the function runs only when the whole page has finished loading.
Inside the event listener function, the code initializes a Leaflet map by creating an instance of the L.map class. The map is assigned to the map variable and is centered at latitude 37.8 and longitude -40.9, with a default zoom level of 3.
Next, the code calls three functions: generateLayers, generateLegend, and plotEarthQuakes. These functions are responsible for setting up the different layers, the legend, and plotting the earthquake data, respectively.
The generateLayers function creates different custom map layers using Mapbox tiles and adds them to the Leaflet map. The function returns a layer group earthquakesLayer, which will be used later to hold the earthquake markers.
The generateLegend function creates a legend control in the bottom-right corner of the map. The legend displays different colors representing depth ranges of earthquakes, along with corresponding labels. The function returns an array legendColors containing the color and label information.
The plotEarthQuakes function fetches earthquake data from a GeoJSON source using D3 (Data-Driven Documents). It then processes the data and plots each earthquake as a circle marker on the map. The size and color of each marker depend on the magnitude and depth of the earthquake, respectively. The function uses the legendColors array to determine the appropriate color for each earthquake marker. Finally, the function adds all the earthquake markers to the earthquakesLayer layer group and adds this layer to the map.
The color_fill function is a helper function used in plotEarthQuakes to determine the color of each earthquake marker based on its depth. It compares the depth of the earthquake to predefined depth ranges in the legendColors array and returns the corresponding color.
Overall, this code creates an interactive map displaying earthquake data with different layers and a legend for depth visualization. The map is centered at a default location, and the earthquake data is fetched from an external source. When the page loads, the map will be displayed, and the earthquake markers will be added dynamically based on the fetched data. The legend will help users understand the depth ranges of the earthquakes represented by the markers.
